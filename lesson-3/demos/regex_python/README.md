Now that we've learned the elements of what make up a regex, let's try writing one for email information. You'll actually be doing something similar to this in an exercise in the Udacity workspace, but here I'm going to show this to you quickly in my terminal.

### 1

The first thing we do is import the `re` library. This is a builtin utility library in Python for regexes.

    import re

### 2

Then, let's actually go an define our regex.
>>>email_regex = r"\b\S+@\S+\.\S+\b"

This is just one example; you might have a more comprehensive regex, but for now, it'll do the job.

Notice here we used a raw string in Python. In general, whenever you define a regex in Python, you use a raw string, which has that `r` in front of the first quote. This is so that the escape characters are treated
appropriately.

### 3

Now, let's define some test strings we can actually user to demonstrate this.

    has_email = "I would like a proper justification as to why my application for a new credit card was rejected. Please email me, Joe Higgins, at joe.higgins@provider.com."
    no_email = "This is no email information here"

### 4

Alright, let's put our regex to the test. We use the `re.search` method to do this.

    re.search(email_regex, has_email)

This method will return an object that describes the match, if it finds one; that's what we see here.
If it doesn't find a match, it'll return `None`

    re.search(email_regex, no_email)

### 4.1

So, for our purposes, what we really care about is whether or not this method returns `None`.
So we could do something like:

    re.search(email_regex, has_email) != None

And then we get `True`. And of course, if we did the same thing as above, but for `no_email`:

    re.search(email_regex, no_email) != None

We get `False`, indicating that there was no match. As expected.


### 5

Now, let's say we want to do a find and replace. For this, we want to use `re.sub`, which will actually replace
all instances that match the regex with a string you specify. Here's how it looks.

    re.sub(email_regex, "[EMAIL REDACTED]", has_email)

So the instances of `man` and `women` have been replaced.

### 6
And, if we passed in `no_email`, then:

    re.sub(email_regex, "[EMAIL REDACTED]", no_email)

The string wouldn't change at all.


### 7

So there we have it; this is how we can detect if a string has a particular type of sensitive data, with a regex,
and actually remove that sensitive data.
